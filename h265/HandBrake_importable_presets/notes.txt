Workflow:

If you have a classic black & white (monochrome) film, use the
"fast x265, black and white film" preset.

If you have a modern, low-noise/low-grain (clean) digital colour film, use the
"fast x265, clean source" preset.

If you have content from the 1950 through early 200s recorded on grainy film
or high-ISO digital sensor, use the "fast x265, grainy/noisy source"
