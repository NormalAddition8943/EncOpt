Workflow:

If you have a classic black & white (monochrome) film:
 - Use the "fast x265, black and white film" preset.
 There is nothing more needed.


If you have a modern, low-noise/low-grain (clean) digital colour film:

 - Run a couple 60-second preset encodings with the "fast x265, clean source" preset.
   Choose challenging chapters if possible. These might be action scenes, have
   fine detail (grass, trees, etc), or be dark scenes with some film grain or noise.
   (We're trying to stress the encoder with some worst-case content).

 - If resulting previews are in the mid 20 MB range up to 30 MB and look good, then you're done!
   Start the encode or add it to your queue.

 - If previews' file size is in the low 20 MB range (or even lower) and/or the results
   look too soft or lack fine/crisp detail, then turn down the CRF slider to 17. Try
   the previews again to confirm they're looking better (at this point, you should be done).


If you have older movies that were shot on film or early digital (with grain or noise):

 - The above "fast x265, clean source" preset likely produced 60-second previews
   larger than 30 MB. So we need to use a grain preset.

 - Select the extra light grain preset and retry the previews and re-assess the filesize.
   If needed, continue trying strong grain presets until filesize is in the mid 20 MB to
   30 MB range.
