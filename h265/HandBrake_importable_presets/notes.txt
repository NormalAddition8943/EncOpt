Workflow:

If you have a classic black & white (monochrome) film, use the
"fast x265, black and white film" preset. Try a couple 30 second previews
and check the quality. The default CRF of 18 holds onto quite a bit
of detail in faces and textures, while saving bitrate in low complexity
areas and averaging some of the grain away temporally.

If you have a modern, low-noise/low-grain (clean) digital colour film, use the
"fast x265, clean source" preset. The default CRF of 16.5 should produce good
results without blowing up bitrate. For extremely detailed and visually
complex movies (for example: Avatar, Way of the Water) consider lowering the
CRF to 18 and running a couple previews.

If you have content from the 1950 through early 2000s recorded on grainy film
or early high-ISO digital cameras, use the "fast x265, grainy/noisy source".
The defaults should work well enough.
